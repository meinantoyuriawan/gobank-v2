## gobank-v2
updated version of my previous project. In this project, I implement a simple bank system using golang and mysql. As a user, we can register a new user and create a many bank account. The method is a simple "get balance", "transfer" and "get recent activity". The methods stated before need an authorization so before we do the methods, we should log into account that we registered before. The method is authenticated using JWT where it does an authentication for every activity. The next explanation of the code will be carried out next commits.
